# Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis on text data. The goal is to classify text as either positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment expressed in the text.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to install the required dependencies and download the necessary data. You can do this by following the instructions in the `README.md` file in the project repository.

## Training the Model

To train the sentiment analysis model, you will need to run the `train.py` script. This script will preprocess the data, train the model, and save the trained model to disk.

## Using the Model

Once the model has been trained, you can use it to perform sentiment analysis on new text data. To do this, you will need to run the `predict.py` script and provide the path to the text data you want to analyze.

## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the test data. However, the accuracy may vary depending on the specific dataset and the preprocessing techniques used.
